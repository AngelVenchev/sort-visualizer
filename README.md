# Sort Visualizer

## Idea
The main idea behind **Sort Visualizer** was to compare the speed of different sorting algorithms while projecting them on the display of the **Connection Machine** at the Telecooperation Office at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

The application works with the real machine which is found in the informatics department in the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
It could also work with the emulator for the machine found [here](http://www.teco.kit.edu/cm/dev/ "here").
